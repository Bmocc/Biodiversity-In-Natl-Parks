Introduction:
In this project, I will analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species at different national park locations.

During this project, I will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the data.

Here are a few questions that I have sought to solve:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
Data sources:

Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was provided by Codecademy.com.

Note: The data that I'll be working with for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.

Scoping:
It's beneficial to create a project scope whenever a new project is being started. Below are four sections to help guide the project process and progress. The first section is the project goals, a section to define the high-level objectives and set the intentions for this project. The next section is the data, luckily in this project, data is already provided but still needs to be checked if project goals can be met with the available data. Thirdly, the analysis will have to be thought through, which include the methods and aligning the question(s) with the project goals. Lastly, evaluation will help build conclusions and findings from the analysis.

Project Goals:
In this project I need to think like a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and the species and their relationship to the parks. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks.

Data:
The project has two data sets, one with information about each species and another with observations of species with locations. This data can be used to analyze the goals of

Analysis:
I will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between species, their conservation status, and observations in parks. I will also use statistical inference, to test if the observed values of conservations status is statistically significant.

Evaluation:
Lastly, I will revisit whether my analysis answered the project goals and what I can share from the project. I can reflect what I have learned, if there are any portions that I was not able to uncover, and if there are next steps that can be taken with different data or methods.
